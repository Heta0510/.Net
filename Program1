In Object0Oriented Programming, a class library is a collection of prewritten classes or coded templates, any of which can be specified and used by a programmer when developing an application
program. The programmer specifies which classes are being used and furnishes data that instantiates each classes as an object that can be called when the program is executed. Access to and 
use  of a class library greatly simplifies the job of the programmer since standard, pretested code is available that the programmer doesn't have to write.
